# HailstoneSequence
Python and Java solution to calculate the Hailstone sequence. 

Java solution:
Run the code using Netbeans or other IDEs simply by importing the project. 
The result of the calculation will be a html file called "results.html" which could be found in project directory.
It is also possible to compile and run the java class using the terminal. For that, go to HailstoneSequence/Java/src and run
$ javac Application.java
The class will be generated in the same directory. To run the class, run the following command:
$ java Application
In this case, the html result file will be generated in the same directory as the class file is located. 

Python:
The python solution is written in Python 3 and only generate the results in the console. Run the code with:
$ python3 code.py
